Welcome to the Node.js Manual!

> Node.js is a platform built on [Chrome's JavaScript runtime](http://code.google.com/p/v8/) for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. &mdash; The official [Node.js website](http://nodejs.org)

This manual consists of three different sections:

* The Node.js API Reference documents the core Node.js modules
* The Node.js Guide contains articles and code samples on coding in Node.js
* The Javascript Reference contains doucmentation about the Javascript language 

You can instantaneously copy and run the code samples found here _live_ into your [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io) account by just clicking a button.

#### Contributing

You can help! This website is a community effort, and is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/c9/nodemanual.org). The API Reference will be in synch with the official Node.js stable APIs. 

Use the `[edit]` links near the article titles to edit them online into the Cloud9 IDE. After writing and updating articles, you can issue a pull request.
